When I saw this rainbow dress, I just knew it was the one for my venue‚Äôs 3rd anniversary party. I raised the neckline a smidge (I love that the designs are customizable!), rocked the dress in 100 degree Texas heat, and literally got complimented all day. I will definitely keep ordering from eShakti. I tell all of my friends!

                    p Finding a good dress that fits can be so hard, but that first moment when you put it on and fall in love sticks in your brain. Having a company that you know you can customize a dress however you want--your exact measurements, your height, sleeve length, neckline, etc. Also, the most important part...they all have POCKETS! I have just fallen in love with shopping from #eshakti When you're 5'10" finding a dress that's long enough isn't hard with eShakti. You should check them out @ eshakti.com (though you might be sucked into scrolling through dresses for hours üòâüòÇ)

                    p At our last performance, people raved about our matching dresses, wondering where we got them. It's certainly not easy finding dresses that fit us and don't require major alterations. So we were thrilled to discover www.eshakti.com this year. Their dresses fit us perfectly right out of the box! Glad Brenda Thoresen discovered them! #eShakti

                    p Just a quick shoutout to #eShakti for relieving one big MOB stress. I liked your customization platform so much, I actually ordered 4 dresses over 3 months. All were a perfect fit and now I am decked out for events for the year. Thanks for helping me find a dress I love. Custom and mail order y‚Äôall!!! www.eshakti.com

                    p When you order dress online and you have the power to customize the style at your own flattering fit, you end up ordering more. Being petite (5‚Äù), it‚Äôs still a challenge to find the right size with a perfect fit. That whenever I bought something that I really like, I usually bring it to the alterations and spend more money.
                    p Sharing this dress from @eshakti that makes me feel the most beautiful. I customize the neckline, sleeves and the length. You just have to provide your measurements and height.
